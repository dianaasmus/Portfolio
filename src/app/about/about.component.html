        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I am a German-speaking Web Developer with experience in building web apps with JavaScript & Angular.<br>
            I started my IT
            journey coding small websites at home and then decided to get professional training and build projects. I am
            looking forward to building on my experience and starting my career in IT in a junior developer position.
