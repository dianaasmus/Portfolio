        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hello! I'm Diana, an enthusiastic frontend developer. I developed a strong connection between
            technology and enjoyment as I grew up. My desire to work in the tech industry has remained unwavering. With
            my creative flair and analytical skills, I've had the opportunity to work on over a dozen projects. <br><br>
            What I find most fulfilling in my work is the journey that each project represents. Each one has given me
            the chance to learn from experienced developers and continually grow. In this ever-evolving technological
            landscape, it's my curiosity that drives me. <br><br>
            I invite you to explore my portfolio, and I look forward to getting to know you better. Together, we
            can achieve great things.
        </p>
